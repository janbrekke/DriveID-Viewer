# DriveID-Viewer
## About
Detect the volume ID number of a connected hard drive.  
A volume serial number is a serial number assigned to a disk volume.   

## History & Purpose
In FAT and NTFS file systems, a volume serial number is a feature used to determine if a disk is present in a drive or not, and to detect if it was exchanged with another one.  
This identification system was created by Microsoft and IBM during their development of OS/2.  
It was introduced in MS-DOS 4.01 back in 1988 and is still with us today.

The volume serial number is a 32-bit number determined by the date and time on the real-time clock on the current computer at the time of a disk's formatting.

## Usage
There are three ways to do this:  
**--{1}--**  
Just run the exe file located in the BIN folder.  
This has been compiled out of the original visual basic file.
It has also gotten itself a nice icon image to make it pretty.
   
**--{2}--**  
Just run the VBS file.
That's it..  
Feel free to modify it as you wish!

**--{3}--**  
Forget about this application\script,  
Click on the start menu  
Type in "CMD",  
hit enter  
Navigate to the drive you need the ID number from  
Type in "vol"  
Hit enter..
   
Really lots of work, takes ages!  
Just look at all the steps! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
   
## What could this possible be useful for?
Well, not much. At least not from what i can find.  
Some may say it's a safety check as the id number will change should the disk or volume be altered\changed in any way,    
BUT i did once encountered an application that required to know the ID number it was installed on back in 2010.
